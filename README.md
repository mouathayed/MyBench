MyBench represents my inaugural foray into developing a Flutter application, serving as the culmination of my final year project and a transformative internship experience with 'Carthage Solutions' company. I collaborated closely with my colleague, Dhaw Amri, who demonstrated proficiency in backend development utilizing Node.js and adeptly managed the database using Postgres. Meanwhile, I assumed the role of crafting the mobile application utilizing Flutter. Through this collaborative synergy, we achieved the successful delivery of a polished, professional-grade solution.
